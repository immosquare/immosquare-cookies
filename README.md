## 🚀 Quick Start

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "immosquare-cookies"
```

Run:

```bash
bundle install
```

Add to your layout or view:

```erb
<%= render("immosquare-cookies/consent_banner") %>
```

## 📦 Installation

### Rails 6+ with modern bundling

For modern Rails applications using `cssbundling-rails` or similar:

1. Add the following to your `package.json` scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:css": "ruby scripts/compile_sass.rb",
    "build:css-dev": "ruby scripts/compile_sass.rb development"
  }
}
```

2. Create `scripts/compile_sass.rb`:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require_relative "../config/environment"

cmd = "sass ./app/assets/stylesheets/application.sass.scss ./app/assets/builds/application.css #{Rails.application.config.assets.paths.map {|path| "--load-path=#{path}" }.join(" ")}"
cmd += ARGV[0] == "development" ? " --source-map --source-map-urls=absolute --watch" : " --style compressed"

system(cmd)
```

3. Update your `Procfile.dev`:

```
web: bin/rails server -p 3000
css: bun run build:css-dev
js: bun run build-dev --watch
```


## 🎯 Usage

### Basic usage

```erb
<%= render("immosquare-cookies/consent_banner") %>
```

### With privacy and cookie policy links

```erb
<%= render("immosquare-cookies/consent_banner",
    privacy_policy_link: "https://example.com/privacy",
    cookie_policy_link: "https://example.com/cookies") %>
```

### Advanced usage with cookie management

```erb
<%= render("immosquare-cookies/consent_banner",
    site_name: "MyApp",
    duration_months: 12,
    privacy_policy_link: "https://example.com/privacy",
    cookie_policy_link: "https://example.com/cookies",
    cookies_to_remove: ["_ga", "_gid", "_fbp", "_gat"],
    target: "_blank") %>
```

## 🍪 Smart Cookie Management

**New in v2.0!** The `cookies_to_remove` parameter automatically removes unwanted cookies when users refuse consent.

```erb
<%= render("immosquare-cookies/consent_banner",
    cookies_to_remove: ["_ga", "_gid", "_fbp", "_gat_UA-*"]) %>
```

This prevents tracking cookies from being recreated and ensures true GDPR compliance.

### Conditional script loading

Check consent before loading tracking scripts:

```erb
<% if cookies["_immosquare_consented"] != "false" %>
  <!-- Google Analytics -->
  <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
  <script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
  </script>
<% end %>
```
